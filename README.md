# Work
First created a app named work. Then installed bootstrap in it using the command 'npm install bootstap'. Then created three components globally using 'ng g c component name' Designed the three pages using css and html added function in respective typescript, called these functions in respective html file. Called these three components in app.component.html.

Here we used the concept of service.Service is any piece of code shared by controller, it can be injected any where we need.We can create a service busing the command ng g service name or create a folder named service in app and created a file named 'info-service.ts'.
Then created a class using the command export class classname 'myservice' then created a method named 'onclickbtn'. Then we need to inject it in ts of component here in 'iot.component.ts'. Then given the title value we need to be displayed 'title=gadgeon'. Then declared the service class as constant here 'service'. Then using the constant name we called the method created in the service.
